abstract = {We propose a lightguide-type super multi-view near-eye display that uses a digital micromirror device and a LED array. The proposed method presents three-dimensional images with a natural monocular depth cue using a compact combiner optics which consists of a thin lightguide and holographic optical elements (HOEs). Feasibility of the proposed method is verified by optical experiments which demonstrate monocular three-dimensional image presentation over a wide depth range. We also analyze the degradation of the image quality stemming from the spectral spread of the HOEs and show its reduction by a pre-compensation exploiting an adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer.},
