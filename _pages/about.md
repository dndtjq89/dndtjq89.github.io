I’m a Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**, supervised by **Prof. Jae-Hyeung Park**. I'm currently focusing on advancing immersive and comfortable VR/AR devices. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D display Optics** and **Computational Optics**, with a primary focus on **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Near-Eye Displays (NEDs)**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between physical and digital worlds by developing optical systems that achieve **realistic occlusion** and seamless integration.

Currently, I am focusing on:
**Next-Gen AR/VR Optics:** Designing optical architectures for immersive visual experiences.
**Computational Optics:** Applying deep learning approach to solve inverse problems in optics.

My goal is to develop innovative optical designs paired with effective algorithms and materials to help shape the future of these technologies.
