I’m a Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**, supervised by **Prof. Jae-Hyeung Park**. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D display Optics** and **Computational Optics**, with a primary focus on **Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Near-Eye Displays**. I am currently passionate about bridging the gap between physical and digital worlds by developing optical systems that achieve **realistic occlusion** and seamless integration. 

I hope that my efforts will be of some help to the happiness of many people.
