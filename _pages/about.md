I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/3doelab" target="_blank">**Three-Dimensional Optical Engineering Lab.** </a> at Seoul National University., supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=gsRN054AAAAJ" target="_blank">**Prof. Jae-Hyeung Park**</a>. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D display Optics** and **Computational Optics**, with a primary focus on **Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Near-Eye Displays**. I am currently passionate about bridging the gap between physical and digital worlds by developing optical systems that achieve **realistic occlusion** and seamless integration. 

I hope that my efforts will be of some help to the happiness of many people.
