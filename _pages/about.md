I am a Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Seoul National University**, Republic of Korea.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D isplay Optics** and **Computational Optics**, with a primary focus on **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Near-Eye Displays (NEDs)**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between physical and digital worlds by developing optical systems that achieve **realistic occlusion** and seamless integration.

Currently, I am focusing on:
* **Next-Gen AR/VR Optics:** Designing optical architectures for immersive visual experiences.
* **Computational Optics:** Applying deep learning approach to solve inverse problems in optics.

My ultimate goal is to bridge the physical and digital worlds through advanced occlusion optics. I aspire to create lifelike AI companions that can interact seamlessly with humans, creating a truly immersive medium for global connection.
